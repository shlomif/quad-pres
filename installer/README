This is Quad-Pres, a Web Meta Language and Perl-5 based tool for 
creating presentations.

It uses Autoconf as the installer, so consult INSTALL for installation
instructions (./configure, make, make install should work).

After it is installed type "quadp -man" for usage instructions.

The Quad-Pres homepage is at:

Consult it for instructions on how to build presentations with it.
