This is Quad-Pres, a
[Website Meta Language](http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/website-meta-language/)
and Perl 5-based tool for creating presentations.

**NOTE**: this is old, legacy, software that fell out of favour so you should
probably not use it. See [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/)
amd similar for more modern takes on this task.

Quad-Pres uses CMake as the installer, so consult INSTALL for installation
instructions.

After it is installed type "quadp -man" for usage instructions.

The Quad-Pres homepage is at:
